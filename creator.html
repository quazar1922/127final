 <h2><strong>Getting to Know the Creator and Editor of Single, Happy and Free!</h2>
<img src="Creatorimage.jpg" height="225" width="225" alt="Vonetta Cartwright">
 <p>Hello. My name is Vonetta Cartwright. I am the creator and editor of Single, Happy and Free magazine.  For 50 years, I have had to justify not being married or having children. I have decided to live these last 50 years being true to myself. Life is meant to be lived according to the choices that you make.  This magazine is a tribute to the women that decided to live according to their own truth.  Join me on this journey to self discovery and fufillment.</p>
